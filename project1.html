                        <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian 
                        aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
                         Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
                          science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research 
                          Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
                           efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic
                            missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political
                             role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]
